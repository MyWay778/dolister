# ![Dolister logo](/public/images/title__image.png) Dolister Todo list
This is my first JS full-stack pet-project. ðŸš€

* Vanilla JavaScript  
* Node.js
* Express
* mongoose

I created this project inspired by a wonderful book ['Learning Web App Development'](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-web-app/9781449371388/) by Semmy Purewal.
I used simple JS, and faced the fact that I was trying to split the code into several parts according to their purpose, it was not so easy ðŸ”§ ... rewrote it at least twice.
